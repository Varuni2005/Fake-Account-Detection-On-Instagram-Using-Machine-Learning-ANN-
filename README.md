# Fake-Account-Detection-On-Instagram-Using-Machine-Learning-ANN-
 Developed an efficient machine learning model that can automatically identify and classify fake Instagram accounts by  analyzing various user profile attributes and activity patterns. The goal is to reduce the prevalence of fake accounts on the  platform by providing a reliable mechanism for account verification with accuracy of 90% 

 Features
Data Analysis: The model analyzes key attributes such as follower/following ratio, post frequency, bio content, and profile picture authenticity.

Machine Learning Model: Utilizes a trained classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or a Neural Network) to predict the likelihood of an account being fake.

High Accuracy: Achieved a verified accuracy of 90% in identifying fake accounts on a test dataset.

Scalability: The model and its pipeline are designed to handle large volumes of user data, making it suitable for platform-wide implementation.

Reliable Verification: Provides a reliable mechanism for automatically flagging accounts for further review or deactivation.
